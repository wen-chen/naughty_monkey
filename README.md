# Naughty Monkey

A fun theorem says that a monkey tapping the keyboard randomly and finally it writes Shakespeare’s works. Maybe I’m just a **naughty monkey**, also tapping the keyboard every day. Surely, I failed to write Shakespeare’s works.  

This repository contains some useful and reusable scripts.
